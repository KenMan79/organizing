**Thank you for volunteering!**

_Thank you for your interest in starting a new ProtoSchool chapter in your local area and hosting live events based on our curriculum! Local ProtoSchool events give attendees the opportunity to work through our tutorials with the help of mentors, and our community depends on individuals like you stepping forward to lead!_

_Before submitting this issue, please double check the [chapter list](https://proto.school/#/chapters) on our website and the existing [new chapter requests](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anew-chapter) to confirm there's not already a chapter in your area. If not, please carry on!_

_Please note that ProtoSchool chapters are led by awesome individuals, not by organizations. It will be your personal responsility as a chapter organizer to uphold your chapter's Code of Conduct. Organizing a ProtoSchool chapter does not create a partnership between an individual organizer (or their employer) and ProtoSchool, Protocol Labs, or related projects (IPFS, Filecoin, etc.)._

____________________________________

 **Introduce Yourself**
_Please tell us a bit about your interest in the decentralized web! Be sure to share your Twitter handle (if you have one), any related organizations or communities you're already involved with in the local area, etc._

**Co-Organizers**
_Will anyone else be co-organizing with you? If so, please be sure to share their GitHub handle so we can include everyone needed when setting up your repo._

**What geographic area will your ProtoSchool chapter serve?**
_In most cases, this should be a city. (Don't forget to add your location to the title of this issue as well!)_

**What should we call your repo?**
_In almost all cases, this will be the name of your city, with hyphens if multiple words, such as `los-angeles`._

**Have you read and do you agree to abide by the ProtoSchool Code of Conduct?**
_All chapter organizers must review and agree to abide by the overarching [ProtoSchool Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)._

**How should Code of Conduct violations within your chapter be reported?**
_Although ProtoSchool has an overarching [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the community as a whole, it will be your responsibility as a chapter organizer to ensure an inclusive and welcoming community by enforcing a Code of Conduct specific to your own chapter's repo, website (if applicable), and live events. Please provide an email address and any additional contact information that your members may use to report any violations of your chapter's Code of Conduct. All contact information provided should belong to a specific individual, not a corporation._
