# Creating a local Code of Conduct

All hosts of ProtoSchool workshops are required to publish a local Code of Conduct in line with [ProtoSchool's global Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Your local Code of Conduct must provide clear guidelines on how attendees can report Code of Conduct violations to your local leadership team. 

In our resources doc you'll find [tips for creating a welcoming and inclusive environment](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/RESOURCES.md#tips-for-creating-a-welcoming-and-inclusive-environment), including Code of Conduct templates and guidance on implementation and enforcement. You are welcome to use these resources to create a new Code of Conduct or to review and improve your group's existing Code of Conduct. In either case, you'll need to be sure to add a section referencing ProtoSchool's global Code of Conduct. 

Alternatively, you may use our local Code of Conduct template, which already includes such a reference.


### Referencing ProtoSchool's global Code of Conduct (mandatory) 

If you'll be hosting ProtoSchool workshops as part of a group that already has an existing Code of Conduct and clear reporting guidelines, please add a section referencing [ProtoSchool's global Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which will apply only to ProtoSchool workshops (those that present our tutorials) and not to other events hosted by your group. It should both: 
- Note that the global ProtoSchool Code of Conduct applies (in addition to your local policies) for ProtoSchool workhops
- Note that in addition to the reporting procedures noted for all of your group's events, in the specific case of ProtoSchool workshops, attendees may also reach out to the global ProtoSchool organizing team to report problems with the local team leaders. (The wording should be clear that this is only an option for ProtoSchool workshops, as opposed to all events hosted by your group.)

Consider adding something like this: 
```md
### Additional reporting options for ProtoSchool workshops
When our organization hosts ProtoSchool workshops, our organizers and participants 
are bound by the global ProtoSchool Code of Conduct in addition to all local policies 
shared here.  In the case of a conflict of interest with the local organizing team, 
of if you feel that the local organizers are not living up to the standards laid out 
in this Code of Conduct, please follow the reporting procedures laid out in the broader 
[ProtoSchool Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 
to reach the project's lead maintainers.
```

### Using our local Code of Conduct template (optional)

If you're hosting a one-off event or if your group doesn't yet have a Code of Conduct, you are welcome to adapt our [local Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/assets/code-of-conduct/template.md) for your group. It includes sections on procedures for reporting incidents both to your local leadership team and to the global ProtoSchool organizers. (Note that this escalation option is only available for ProtoSchool workshops and does not apply to other events hosted by your group.)

For the local reporing section, be sure to replace the wording with the correct contact information for your team, adapting to suit the number of organizers and whether you use individual emails or a group address: 

##### Single organizer
```md
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting chapter organizer **NAME** at **[EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL)**.
```

##### Mutliple organizers with individual email addresses
```md
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting chapter organizers **NAME ([EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL))**,
**NAME ([EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL))**, or **NAME ([EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL))**.
```

##### Multiple organizers sharing an email address
```md
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the chapter organizing team at
**[EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL)**.
```

The suggestions above are for sharing email addresses, but you may want to also add a phone number or an anonymous reporting form as well.
